Skipped star exercises 4.11 and 4.12 and moving forward to get a good picture of overall course instead of wasting time in nitty gritty. Will come back to it later when revising stuff.


UPDATE 12 JULY 2023 10:14
Decided to pause implementation of exercise 4.6 as it is not necessary to move forward. Moving forward to next topics. Will come back later for this exercise in revision. By moving faster we get a full picture of course and architecture of overall application.
